I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows
They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze
I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told

[Verse 1: KSI]
I'm in my prime, and this ain't even final form
They knocked me down, but still, my feet, they find the floor
I went from living rooms straight out to sold-out tours
Life's a fight, but trust, I'm ready for the war

[Pre-Chorus: KSI]
Woah-oh-oh
This is how the story goes
Woah-oh-oh
I guess this is how the story goes

[Chorus: KSI]
I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows
They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze
I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I'vе been told

[Verse 2: KSI]
From the screen to the ring, to the pеn, to the king
Where's my crown? That's my bling, always drama when I ring
See, I believe that if I see it in my heart
Smash through the ceiling 'cause I'm reaching for the stars
S
